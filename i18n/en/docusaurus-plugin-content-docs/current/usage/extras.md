Allows you to upscale the image.

## Scale factor
* `Scale by` - how many times to upscale the picture
* `Scale to` - alternative variant: to what size upscale the picture.

## Upscaler 1,2 {#upscalers}

Here you can select the upscalers that we will use. You can use either one or two (for better quality)

Personally, I settled on `R-ESRGAN 4++` as the first upscaler and `SwinlR_4x` as the second.

## Upscaler 2 visibility

Adjusts the effect of the second upscaler on the final picture, you can turn it down if it seems too strong.
